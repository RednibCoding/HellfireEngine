1. **Free Usage**: The HellfireEngine may be used to create and distribute video games, both commercially and non-commercially, without any fees.

2. **Bundling with Games**: When distributing a game created with HellfireEngine, the runtime (engine executable) may be renamed to reflect the game’s title, and the executable's icon may be changed for branding purposes. The user-defined configuration files (`.ini` files) and assets (such as images, sounds, etc..) may also be bundled with the renamed executable to create the final game package.

3. **No Standalone Redistribution**: The HellfireEngine itself (in its original or modified form) may not be distributed, sold, or monetized as a standalone product. The engine can only be distributed as part of a game created using HellfireEngine, and only to the extent necessary for the game to function.

4. **Modification and Forking**: Users are allowed to fork and modify the HellfireEngine for personal or internal use only. However:
   - Redistribution of the engine, whether modified or unmodified, under any name other than "HellfireEngine" is strictly prohibited.
   - Modifying game-specific configuration files (.ini files) is allowed for creating new games, but modifying the core runtime of HellfireEngine and redistributing it, even as part of a game, is prohibited.

5. **Attribution Requirement**: Any game produced using HellfireEngine (whether modified or unmodified) must display the text "Powered by HellfireEngine" in the game's title screen, credits, or another prominent location within the game.

6. **No Claiming Ownership**: Users may not claim the HellfireEngine, in its original or modified form, as their own creation. The original authorship of HellfireEngine must always be acknowledged.

7. **No Circumvention**: Users may not create or distribute wrappers, plugins, or other software intended to repackage, circumvent, or obscure the licensing restrictions of the HellfireEngine.

8. **No Sale or Distribution of the Engine**: The HellfireEngine (whether in original or modified form) may not be sold, sublicensed, or distributed as a standalone product. It may only be bundled with games to the extent necessary for the game's functionality.

9. **License Distribution Requirement**: This license must always be distributed alongside any copy of the HellfireEngine, whether in its original form or modified, as well as with any game that uses HellfireEngine. The license must be provided either within the game's distribution files or in a separate accompanying file, clearly accessible to users.
